mpOTR_verif
===========

This is mpOTR protocol analysis wich is connected to another project:

https://github.com/maria-msu-seclab/mpotrDevelopment

mpOTR is a protocol for encrypted group communications with deniability 
feature. Current project aims to verify security properties of the protocol
and\or find the possible attacks.

The tool we use for protocol analysis and verification is Maude-NPA 
developed by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign:

We higly appreciate your ideas, questions and any other comments, see our 
info at AUTHORS


Work in progress:
 * Connection phase -- Done
 * Auth phase -- Done  
 * Need More Auth attacks (like impersonation)
 * Communication phase + OldBlue
 * Finilising phase -- make finalisation checks
 * Protocol as a whole
 * Overall attacks

 Questions: 
 * What to do with verification checks? Just omit them? *Logical*
 * What's with the long-term private-public key usage at Auth stage? (!!!)
   -- May be describe x_i as permanent private Key
   There is nothing about it yet
 * How to describe attack on the deniability feature?
   -- Some kind of that there is no connection between (s_i, S_i) and (x_i, y_i)
      mpCat draft && that paper, depends on the deniability definition.
 * How to describe attack on the PFC feature?
   -- No connection between long-term key and session simm key 
Ideas for previous two is 
      if intruder knows the long-term secret keys she cannot guess the 
	  session key and ephemeral private key. Will this be equal to the 
	  abcence of a proof of that the certain long-term private key has 
	  participated in particular conversation?
 * What's with Old Blue protocol? (Full description?)
    Only if we are able to decribe attacks like preventing message delivery or
	reply attacks or mixing messages attacks, that's not only the channel issue.
 * What other kinds of attacks could be for AKE?
 * (And what kind of features do we support and need to check with the Maude-
   NPA checker?)
 * I'd really need some kind of variables -- the messages grow bigger and bigger
 * What should I be telling during the presentation the other week?
 * Do we need to make finalization checks like those that we have no more messages in the channel (May be not, that's a realization stuff) or that the transcript is consistent (May be yes, we need to be be consistent at the end,  but only if we use the OldBlue protocol)?
